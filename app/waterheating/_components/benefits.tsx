            Contributing to climate change mitigation
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm">
            Switching to solar water heaters/geysers can significantly lower
            your carbon footprint. Traditional water heaters are often a
            significant source of CO2 emissions because they burn fossil fuels.
            In contrast, solar water heaters/geysers harness clean, renewable
            energy mitigating CO2 emissions and contributing to a healthier
            planet. Make the switch today and become a part of the solution
            rather than the problem on climate change.

            investment that not only benefits you today but will do so in the
            future.
